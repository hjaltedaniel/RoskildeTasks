# Sponsorship

Are you a company that depends on Archetype? We would love for you to sponsor us! Here's some suggested ways below!

## Sponsor a Sprint

We have a [backlog](https://github.com/kgiszewski/Archetype/issues), it gets worked on when either we have a personal need, we get bored or when we get a sponsorship. If you want to sponsor a sprint, we can give you thanks on social media and if you're really generous, we can put your logo and link on a well placed spot in a version release. [Contact us](https://twitter.com/ArchetypeKit) to get started.

## Donations

If you want to quietly support us, you can also send us a donation:
